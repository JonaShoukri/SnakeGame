 SnakeGame

The game we have created uses WASD keys to move around followed by the enter key. The point was to try creating a snake game using 0 outside sources.

For now our program runs using two threads (in game class). One awaits user input and changes the snakes direction when input is detected. The other is responsible for the rest of the game logic as well as plotting the actual visuals on the console.
